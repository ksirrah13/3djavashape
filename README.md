# My 3D Shape Generator
created by Kyle Harris

My 3D Shape Generator is an application that creates and displays the illusion of 3D shapes in a 2D plane. This is accomplished by calculating the location of vertices with rotations applied them, connecting them with edges and repainting the image.

The user is able rotate the shapes using the keyboard or buttons on the bottom. The user is also able to change the dimensions of the shape using the sliders on the left and view the changes updated live in the viewing window.

The entire application is built using Java layout managers that allow the window to be scaled to create a larger view area or shrunk to create a more compact window while still allowing full functionality and view of all controls.

This project came about from a desire to create 3D shapes by mapping them to vertices and edges to be viewed in a 2D plane. I also wanted to learn how to override and use the paint method in Java. Other new skills and concepts I learned and developed was use of the BoxLayout and CardLayout, using JSlider components, and creating action listeners that reference components relative to the source.
